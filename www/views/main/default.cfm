		Welcome to the JavaScript 201 Workspace project. This project provides
		a workspace for hands on JavaScript learning. I mainly use this project
		when mentoring and coaching others on JavaScript concepts such as
		functions as first class citizens and closures.

		To start the project up simply open a command line and type
		<strong>start.bat</strong> in Windows, or <strong>./start.sh</strong>
		in *nix environments.
